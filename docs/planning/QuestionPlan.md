#Question Plan
- This plan includes questions for each level to be asked, also included are the answers followed by 2 fake answers as the questions will be presented as multiple choice.
- When adding questions to the game, the answers should be mixed up so that the correct answer is in a different position for each question to ensure there isn't a pattern for users to guess to aid learning.
- Each level should have at least 10 questions.

## Level 1
- “First things first, I need to see what went wrong with the security in the house. I need to define the CIA triad – now what does it stand for?”
    *= Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability*
    *= Confidentiality, Identity, Acceptability*
    *= Competence, Identity, Availability*

- "Let's look at confidentiality. before I can find any clues that link to it, I need to define it. Select the definition of confidentiality"
    *= preventing unauthorized disclosure of information. Includes secrecy, privacy*
    *= preventing downtime of systems or inability to access data/information*
    *= preventing unauthorized modification of data and systems*

- "Looking at this clue here reminds me of one of the CIA triad elements, I remember a definition, 'it prevents unauthorised modification of data and systems' but which one of the elements does it belong, let me think."
    *= Integrity*
    *= Availability*
    *= Identity*

- "This clue is fascinating I think it's to do with the availability element of the CIA triad. I should check by looking at the definition. Select the definition of availability"
    *= preventing downtime of systems or inability to access data/information*
    *= preventing unauthorized modification of data and systems*
    *= preventing unauthorized disclosure of information. Includes secrecy, privacy*

- "Hmmm, it looks like the victim, Ginny, had granted someone permission to access a file, what is the name of this process?"

    *= Authentication*
    *= Apple bobbing*

- "I wonder if the hacker managed to gain authentication? Select the definition of authentication"
