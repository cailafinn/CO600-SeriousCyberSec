#Question Plan
- This plan includes questions for each level to be asked, also included are the answers followed by 2 fake answers as the questions will be presented as multiple choice.
- When adding questions to the game, the answers should be mixed up so that the correct answer is in a different position for each question to ensure there isn't a pattern for users to guess to aid learning.
- Each level should have at least 10 questions.

## Level 1
- “First things first, I need to see what went wrong with the security in the house. I need to define the CIA triad – now what does it stand for?”
    - *= Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability*
    - *= Confidentiality, Identity, Acceptability*
    - *= Competence, Identity, Availability*

- "Let's look at confidentiality. Before I can find any clues that link to it, I need to define it. Select the definition of confidentiality"
    - *= preventing unauthorized disclosure of information. Includes secrecy, privacy*
    - *= preventing downtime of systems or inability to access data/information*
    - *= preventing unauthorized modification of data and systems*

- "Looking at this clue here reminds me of an element from the CIA triad, the definition of it is, 'it prevents unauthorised modification of data and systems' but which one of the elements does it belong to?"
    - *= Integrity*
    - *= Availability*
    - *= Identity*

- "This clue is fascinating I think it's to do with the availability element of the CIA triad. I should check by looking at the definition. Select the definition of availability"
    - *= preventing downtime of systems or inability to access data/information*
    - *= preventing unauthorized modification of data and systems*
    - *= preventing unauthorized disclosure of information. Includes secrecy, privacy*

- "Hmmm, it looks like the victim, Ginny, had granted someone permission to access a file, what is the name of this process?"
    - *= Authorisation*
    - *= Authentication*
    - *= Apple bobbing*

- "I wonder if the hacker managed to gain authentication? Select the definition of authentication"
    - *= the process of confirming the truth or correctness of the claimed artefact or identity*
    - *= the process of granting permission to someone/thing to do some action (e.g., access files)*
    - *= the process of hanging a picture on the wall*

- "This clue looks linked to the factor Non-repudiation to me. Select the definition of non-repudiation"

    - *= Collection of connected computing devices, personnel, infrastructure, applications, services, telecommunications systems*
    - *= Collection of scout badges*

- "This clue seems to point in the direction of computer security. Which of the following can be used to describe what computer security is?"
    - *= Freedom from undesirable events in a system, either accidental or malicious*
